## Customizing your map

Your map is already up and online. You need to customize it.

### About WorkAdventu.re maps

In order to design a map that will be readable by WorkAdventure, you will have to respect some constraints.

In particular, you will need to:

- set a start position for the players
- configure the "floor layer" (so that WorkAdventure can correctly display characters above the floor, but under the ceiling)
- eventually, you can place exits that link to other maps

All this is described in the [WorkAdventure documentation](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/workadventure/#designing-a-map).
Please be sure to check it out. 

### Pushing the map

When your changes are ready, you need to "commit" and "push" the changes back to GitHub.
Just wait a few minutes, and your map will be propagated automatically to the GitHub pages web-server.
